\section{Introduction}

In this document, we describe the distribution of UNIT resources. UNIT governance is the DAO that governs UNIT’s main algorithm and processes to establish an index that can serve as a crypto benchmark and a crypto-native unit of account. For a complete description of UNIT’s main algorithm, see \cite{B1}.

\subsection{UNIT's Resources}

UNIT’s governance token, UN, is the controlling voting unit governing UNIT’s algorithm. The maximum amount to ever enter circulation is $2^{33}$ UN tokens.

\subsection{Allocation}

UN is allocated as shown in Figure \ref{fig:allocation}.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Vesting}

An amount of the initial UN will be vested for the times defined in Figure \ref{fig:allocation_timeline}. Team, Early Development, Pre-IDO, and Development Fund will have vesting schedules. For an allocation schedule with inflation rates see Figure \ref{fig:allocation_timeline}.

\section{Development Links}

UNIT’s ideas started in 2018; however, it was not as necessary in the crypto space then as it is today. Therefore, the project began testing the hypothesis of an indexed unit of account in 2021. It is now running strong towards executing the plan.

We first launched UNIT’s algorithm online on May 5, 2021. Currently. Follow our development at \href{http://www.unitindex.org}{unitindex.org}.
